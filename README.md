# Homework: Project Management and post-its

We would like you to think about your research question, specifically the digital scholarship component, within the context of the following points:

*Inputs* - what data and other sources will you need to answer or formulate your question.

*Processes* - what will you need to do with your data or with your sources in order to answer your question? Think about how much time and resources you will need for these. Etc. What tools, resources, etc. Don’t worry if you don’t know which specific tools to use.

*Outputs* - what will the finished processes look like? Maps, interviews, graphs, tables, etc?

When we come in on Tuesday morning we will go through an exercise of writing these out on post-it notes and developing a flexible/adaptable schedule for your project weeks. We will also focus on how how to engage with the workshops leading up to the project weeks in order to best. One of the big goals/takeaways from this assignment will be to have some concrete projects and tasks that you will be able to complete and share within the time-frame of the program.
